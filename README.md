**Why make this?**

A: fun


**What commands can E-DOS run?**

A: It can use a few commands, as well as some custom ones. We are working on making pretty much all standard linux commands usable and making a "working" VHD.

**Can I connect to the Internet with E-DOS?**

A: No, not in the base version. However it is possible to if you compile it yourself and add in the necessary code.
