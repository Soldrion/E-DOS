# What is Crimson?
Crimson is the designation for the version of E-DOS that runs only via embeds or raw html files.

**What is the difference?**
Crimson is more limited in its' ability to be scaled graphicly, possible internet connections, and some minor things. However, the code is still the same and will function just as the main version is. It's just that Crimson will be able to be usable before the main version is.

**Why make this?**

A: I wanted to have something fun and challenging to do while I was bored.


**What commands can E-DOS run?**



A: It can use the ls and cd commands, as well as a few custom ones. We are working on making pretty much all standard linux commands usable and making a "working" VHD.

**Can I connect to The Internet with E-DOS?**

A: No, not in its' current state. It is a custom-made emulation of an emulation of a linux terminal from scratch. This version of E-DOS is likely not going to connect to the intenet, it is an embed/localhost-page only version.
