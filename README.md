big thanks to imlvna for being big help / contributor


**Why make this?**

A: fun


**What commands can E-DOS run?**

A: It can use the ls and cd commands, as well as a few custom ones. We are working on making pretty much all standard linux commands usable and making a "working" VHD.

**Can I connect to The Internet with E-DOS?**

A: No, not in its' current state. It is a custom-made emulation of an emulation of a linux terminal from scratch. However, if the right tools are used there is an actual possibilty you could connect this to the internet.
